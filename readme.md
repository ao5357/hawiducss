#Hawidu CSS
Hawidu CSS is _the_ single-file CSS framework:

 * No sprawl, deploy as-is
  * Limits unnecessary cascading
  * Provides common-sense organization and coding style
 * Base: normalizes elements and trusts browsers
 * Progressive enhancement: form elements, pretty blockquotes
 * Semantic: even the utility classes

##Features

 * Pasteins: paste widgets in your stylesheet as needed, contribute new ones back
 * Consistent form elements
 * Tapered List bullets
 * {{{<hr />}}} embellishments
 * HTML5 basic layout
 * Zero file/image dependencies

##Roadmap
Hawidu CSS is an active project moving toward a 1.0 release that will include the best documentation of any CSS Framework, a testing suite, pasteins, Wordpress theme, and Drupal 7 theme.

##tl;dr
Build your next project with Hawidu CSS and have a time-saving and *maintainable style base* that doesn't rely on [killing you](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2011/04/28/our-best-practices-are-killing-us/) or [leaky abstractions](http://leaverou.me/2011/03/on-css-preprocessors/).
