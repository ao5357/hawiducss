#Hawidu CSS
Hawidu CSS is _the_ single-file CSS framework:

 * No sprawl, deploy as-is
  * Limits unnecessary cascading
  * Provides common-sense organization and coding style
 * Base: normalizes elements and trusts browsers
 * Progressive enhancement: form elements, pretty blockquotes
 * Semantic: even the utility classes

[See the wiki](https://github.com/ao5357/hawiducss/wiki) for tons of documentation.
##Features

 * Pasteins: paste widgets in your stylesheet as needed, contribute new ones back
 * Consistent form elements
 * Tapered List bullets
 * ```<hr />``` embellishments
 * HTML5 basic layout
 * Zero file/image dependencies
